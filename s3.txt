S3: Simple Storage Service : AWS Version of GDrive..

--> Block Based Storage : Designed to run the OS		: EBS, Instance Store
--> Storage Over Network (SAN/NAS) 				: EFS, FSx
--> Object Based Storage : Designed to store flat files		: S3

S3:
--> We can store any file.
--> We cannot install / Run Operating SYstem / Application.

--> We store all data in Buckets. 
--> Bucket is a Directory/Folder, with Unique namespace across the globe.
--> Defaultly, 100 is a softlimit for bucket count. 

--> S3 Bucket Naming standards.. 
	--> Min 3 Char, Max 63 Char
	--> should not contains Uppercase letter
	--> Should not start with . end with . no adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
	--> Should not begin with xn--


--> S3 is a Global resource. (From Single console we can see all region resources).
--> WHile creating we need to choose the region, Actual data stores there.


Free Tier : 
5 GB Standard Storage
2000 PUT (Upload)
20,000 GET (Downloads)

--> In S3, No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> Pay-as-you-go.
--> We can store Unlimited Data in S3 platform.

--> In AWS, Based on access patterns, we can choose the approprite Storage class. 


Access Pattern : How freq data is accessed. 

		GDrive		AWS S3

100 gb		90 gb		

Freq		10 gb		Standard
InFreq		20 gb		Standard-IA / OneZone-IA
Archieve	50 gb		Glacier / Glacier Deep Archieve
Don't know	10 gb		Intelliget Tier


S3-Standard : Frequetly accessed data..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.99%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

Standard-IA (infrequntly access) : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across >=3 AZs
Availablility : 99.9%, Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3-OneZone IA : In-Frequetly accessed data.. But available immediatley..  Data Spread across 1 AZs
Availablility : 99.5% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

S3 Gacier : Archive data for shorter durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. Retival takes Min-Hours..
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3 Glacier Deep Archieve : Archive data for longer durations.. Data will not be available immedialtly.. Retival Hours to Days..
We need to perform data retrival to get the data.. 
Availablility : 99.99% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

S3-Intelligent tier : If we have unknown access patterns.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) Data Spread across >=3 AZs

RRS : Reduced Redundancy Storage : Non-Critical data / easily reprodusable data.. 
Availablility : 99.9% , Durability: 99.99%

If we don't have any . in bucket Names..
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in bucket name..
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/foldername/objectname

--> Public Access Settings : Block all Public Access

--> If we want to make any object public, First edit the "Public ACcess Settings" in bucket. then make object Public. 


Glacier Restoration:

Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.



Bucket Versioning : 
___________________

--> S3 keeps multiple copies of our files. 
--> Most recent upload will be available if we don't enable Versioning.
--> If we accidentally delete any object, We can get it back.
--> We can track all changes happening on the file.

Version: HIDE
--> If shows only latest version of the object.
--> If we delete the object, We will get the DELETE Marker.
--> If we want to get the object back, Delete the "Delete Marker".

Version: SHOW
--> It shows all the versions of the object.
--> If you delete any Obj Version, It deletes perminantly.

Multipart upload: FIle becomes as small chunks (parts) then all small parts upload to s3 then it combines.

Replication : DR
	--> CRR (Cross Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in Another region
	--> SRR (Same Region Replication) : Replica copy stores in another bucket in same 		region
--> Versioning must be enabled.

--> Before enabling Replication, Whetever data we have in SOurce, won;t replicate to destination.   (aws s3 sync Sourcebucket destination)



Static website hosting: 
--> S3 supports only static website hosting.
--> Domain Name Should be same as Bucket Name.
--> Index.html / Error.html

http Status Codes : 
2XX : OK / Success
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client Side Error	
5XX : Server Side Error


WinSCP / S3 Browser / Cyberduck / CLoudberry explorer..!!!

--> It will log everything we perform in AWS env. 
--> Data Events, Can log all S3 platform logs. 


Events : 
--> SNS Notification : Demo
--> SQS
--> Lambda

Hybrid cloud:


EC2 : Elastic compute cloude : 

Instance = Server / Box = VM (Virtual machine) = Azure VM = GCP Engine..
 Instance are mainly 3 types
1.On-Demand ec2 instances: Unpredictable workloads/usecases : Test your application with
multiple configs..

Pricing : /hr../sec ( Min of 60 seconds..you have to pay)


Reserved Instance(RI) : Predictable workloads..Longterm runs in aws..We need to choose
th config..
Duration : 1yr / 3ys...

	--> Stadard RI : We cannot change the config..
	-->Convertable RI : We can change config(Upgrade only , there is no down grade)
	-->Scheduled RI : For repeated Req/persistant req..(Ex..mon-fri , weekly 40hrs,)

Pricing :
	-->Full up front ; Pay 100% while purchasing..
	-->Partial Upfront: Pay 30-50% now..AWs reduce the hourly price Pay for the
    		reduced hourly price for actual usage in the month
	--> No Upfront : pay everything monthly basis


Hr : 1$/hr...:300 $ : 0.50%









59 Sec = 1 minute
1 min 10 sec 



Tshirt size ==> how many IPs configured..!!: 


Pay-as-you-go



Server :--> Server rack, network rack, cooling, power connect..os, patches..application.. 


4cpu, 16 gb ram, 1tb hdd...

Task 1 : Launch a windows server 2016 instance, login with initial password, change the password.
 Try to use the system password and verify it works or not..?


task 2: Create a another user in server, provide remote desktop permissions and local admin
permissions. try to connect as that newly created user.

  output: 2 sessions should be active at a time.

EFS: Elastic file system: (we regularly called it as File share also)
-->It works with NFS v4.1 Protocol (Network file system)
-->EFS supports only LINUX OS.
-->EFS Security Group must be opened with NFS port number.
-->we can mount it to 100s/1000s of Instace also.
-->whatever the data we haven't acceesed recently, we cane move it to IA
 

sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-a4483a75.efs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com:/ efsstorage

EBS : Block : Dedicated for one ec2 instance
EFS : Storage over the network

Windows : FSx : No Free tier eligibility
-->FSx is for windows OS
-->It works with SMB Protocol..(Server messege Block Protocol)

Elstic Beanstalk
-->One org.. Developing an application..They Don't want to manage the Infra..Their
focus is an application developement. what is the service we can use in aws..?

--->Paas : Platform as a Service..
--->OS level modifications not permited.
--->One platform for one application only.

Lightsail :
-->Everything comes as a bundle.
Cloud practitioner : one org need a website. They don't have any technical resources to
manage the application /code / server / Infra..!!!!! Ans : Lightsail...


Route53: AWS DNS Service

what is DNS
What is DNS record (A Record)
What is hostedzone

Placement Group : AWS places instances on the resource mechanism we selected.

Low n/w latency, High n/w through .. TO sustain power failures / Nerwork resource failures

-->Cluster Placement Group : all the instances are placing in same hard disk
-->Partition Placement group :
-->spread 

-->Use same configuration instance for better performance.

Q : can we Group the instances accross the regions..? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systems Manager :

task  install IIS using systems manager

task2 : Recover a windows password using systems manager.
